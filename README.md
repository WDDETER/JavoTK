# JavoTK
A very lightweight and modular OpenTK wrapper for OpenGL. Keeps things simple while still being flexible, it streamlines many processes like shaders, textures, transforms, lighting, and 3D graphics. Hope you find this helpful!

# Dependencies
For JavoTK you will need the following:

* OpenTK Core
* StbImageSharp

Both can be installed with Nuget.
